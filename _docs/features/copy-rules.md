# Copying Rules Between Environments

When you create and apply [Targeting Rules](targetingrules) to a feature flag, the rules only apply to the current environment. For example, you can create rules on the Test environment without affecting Production environment. This allows developers to try things out in the Test environment before bringing the change to the Production environment which applies to all users. For more information about environments, [read this](../projects).

You can copy flag rules between **environments**, navigate to the rule you want to copy, and click on the Copy icon, present on the top right side.

 <div class="justify-content-center border">
    <img src="/assets/img/copy-rules.png" alt="Copy Rules between environments"/>
</div> 

When you click on the Copy icon, a popup will ask you to choose a destination environment to copy the rule to. After you make the selection and choose to continue, the rule will be copied to the selected environment.
