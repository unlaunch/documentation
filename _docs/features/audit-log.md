# Activity (aka Audit Log)
Acitivity (or audit log) shows a record of events and changes across your project. Anytime, you or a member of your team changes anything (e.g. create / edit flag, update rules, etc.), the activity is recorded and can be seen on the 'Activity' page. Activity logs capture *who* performed an activity, *what* activity was performed, and the *time* if was performed.

To view activity, click on **Activity** in the right sidebar. You will be able to see all changes to your project.
