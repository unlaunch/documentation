# Slack

This tutorial explains how to connect Unlaunch to your Slack account to get real-time notifications as Slack messages on feature flag changes by your team. Using the Slack integration, you can get notified on Slack channel when you or someone on your team:

- Enables or disables a feature flag.
- Increase or decrease gradual rollout.
- Create a new feature flag.
- Archive a feature flag.

Please follow these steps to connect Unaunch to your Slack account.

### Step 1: Add 'Incoming WebHooks' App to Slack

Make sure you are signed into your Slack account. Open the Incoming Webhook in [Slack app directory](https://crovate.slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks).If you are a Slack Workspace Owner, you'll see "Add to Slack" button. Click it and move to Step #2.

</div>

If you are **not an owner** of the Slack account, you'll see the **"Request to Install"** button instead. Click on this button and follow instructions to ask your Slack Workspace Owner to enable this app. Proceed to step #2 once the app is enabled.

### Step 2: Choose a Channel to Receive Notifications
Next, you'll select the channel where Unlaunch notifications will be displayed. After selecting an existing channel (or creating a new one), click "Add Incoming Webhooks Integration" and proceed to Step 3.

</div>

### Step 3: Copy the Webhook URL
In this step, you'll copy the Webhook URL. This is a unique URL that will allow Unlaunch to send notifications to this configuration. After you have copied the URL (by pressing âŒ˜+C or Ctrl+C), proceed to step 4.

    </figure>
</div>

### Step 4: Open Unlaunch Console
Login to the Unlaunch Console by visiting [https://app.unlaunch.io/](https://app.unlaunch.io/). After you log in, click on 'Integrations' on the sidebar. In the page that opens, click on the "Connect" button where you see Slack listed.

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Open Unlaunch Integrations and Choose Slack</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

### Step 5: Paste Webhook URL and Enable Slack Integration
This is the final step. First click on the "Enable" checkbox. In the text field, paste the webhook URL you copied from step #3. Then click the "Save Changes" button. You should receive a welcome message on Slack from Unlaunch confirming that the integration is successful.
