## Overview

This topic explains what a flag's Insights graph does and how to use it.

## Analyzing using Insights graph

With the help of Insights graph, there is clear visibility of how many times a variation is served over a period of time and how it is affecting the business.

To navigate to the Insights tab:

1. Click the feature flag you wish to analyze.
2. You will be landed to flag's **Targeting** page.
3. Click into the **Insights** tab.
4. Flag Insights graphs are generated on a per-flag evaluation basis. This means that if the same user has evaluated 20 times, the Insights graph records and displays all 20 evaluations.
5. Flag variation evaluations can be investigated for last 24 hours, last 7 days, last 14 days and last 30 days.
6. There is dropdown on top right to select the desired timeperiod for insights graph.
