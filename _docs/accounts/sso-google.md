## Google SSO

You can configure your Unlaunch account using Google SSO. Accounts that are created using Google SSO aren't prompted to enter a password when they try to access Unlaunch console. Instead, they are redirected to an external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate.

To create account using Google click on **continue with Google** button present on **Sign up** screen. Here 2F-authentication is not required by Unlaunch. Likewise you can sign in using Google by clicking  **continue with Google** present on **Login** screen.
