## Understanding two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication is used while creating account for security reasons. After successfully filling in registration page, users will be directed to **OTP screen**. 
A 6-digit code will be sent to their email address which should be copied to this screen. Only after that user will be able to get registered to Unlaunch's system.
