# Managing Flags

Feature Flags allow developers to release features safely and confidently. This section has documentation on how to create feature flags, use projects and environments, define targeting rules, and more. Most of this documentation focuses on features that you see when you log in to your account using the [Unlaunch Console](https://app.unlaunch.io).

For more information on what feature flags are, please read this [blog post](https://blog.unlaunch.io/2020-08-01-feature-flags/).
