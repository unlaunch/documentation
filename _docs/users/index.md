# Teams

This page will help you understand how to add and remove members to your Unlaunch project and assign them appropriate roles. To understand roles and permissions, please take a look at this [guide](access-control).

To add, remove and change members, you **must** have admin privileges.

To invite a new user, click on **'Settings'** in the right sidebar. Once the page loads, click on the **'Teams'** tab.

<div class="justify-content-center">
    <img src="/assets/img/add-member-1.png" class="border" alt="add member button"/>
</div>

## Add New User
On the Teams tab, click "Add Member" button.

<div class="justify-content-center pb-3">
    <img src="/assets/img/add-member-2.png" class="border" alt="add member button"/>
</div>

The next screen will ask you to enter the email address of the user who want to invite and the [role](access-control) you want to assign. 

<div class="justify-content-center pb-3">
    <img src="/assets/img/add-member-3.png" class="border" alt="invite member popup"/>
</div>

If the user you are adding is already a part of the organization, they will be added to the project immediately. Otherwise, they'll receive an email invite to create Unlaunch account and join the project. When they accept the invite, they will be added to the project and will assume the same role that you assigned when inviting them.

## Change Role / Access 
If you have Admin privileges, you can change a member's role by clicking the 'Edit' button beside their email address. 

<div class="justify-content-center pb-3">
    <img src="/assets/img/existing-user-added.png" class="border" alt="edit role button"/>
</div>	

For more information on Role based Access Control please see [access control guide](access-control)

## Remove Member
You can also remove users using the same page. To remove a user, click on "Remove" button beside their email address. 

<div class="justify-content-center pb-3">
    <img src="/assets/img/remove-member.png" alt="remove member"/>
</div>
