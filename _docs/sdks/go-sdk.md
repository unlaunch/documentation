# Unlaunch Go SDK

This guide provides complete information about the Unlaunch Go SDK and how to integrate it in your applications to call feature flags.

The Unlaunch Go SDK provides a Go API to access Unlaunch. Using the SDK, you can easily build Go applications that can evaluate feature flags, access configuration, and more. Unlaunch Go SDK is *open source*. SDK source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/unlaunch/go-sdk" rel="nofollow">GitHub <i class="fab fa-github fa-fw"></i></a> You can also checkout the Java [example project](TODO).
